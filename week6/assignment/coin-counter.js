/*
Coin Counter
Create a coin counter application that takes X amount of money (such as Ksh. 499) and determines the exact amount of change needed in 1's, 5's, 10's, 20's, 50's and 100's. Do not worry about adding a user interface to the application. Instead, focus on writing good tests and functional code.
400=>4
50 =>1
20 =>2
5 =>1
1 =>4
Part 1
Create a coin counter function that uses recursion to solve the problem.
*/

/*Part 2
Create a coin counter function that uses a closure that can be used with functions for each type of change (quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies). You can use recursion if you like.
